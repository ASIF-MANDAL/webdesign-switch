# Project Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that's used to design web pages. HTML is made up of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content.

- **CSS**: CSS is the acronym of ‚ÄúCascading Style Sheets‚Äù. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these ‚Äúcascading style sheets‚Äù which are equally called CSS files

- **JS**: JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
